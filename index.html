                        industry, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of various key areas, including account
                        management, credit bureaus, commercial cards, healthcare cards, and credit/debit card
                        transactions. My career has provided me the opportunity to work with leading financial
                        institutions and payment networks, such as Mastercard, Visa, Discover, and American Express.
                        Throughout my career, I have been involved in the full lifecycle of transaction processingâ€”from
                        the creation of payment plastics and internal functionalities to ensuring seamless and secure
                        authorization work. I have also gained extensive expertise in the processing of diverse card
                        types, including credit, debit, and commercial cards.
                        Over the past five years, I have focused on authorization systems, handling the complexities of
                        verifying and processing transactions in real time for a variety of card products. My experience
                        includes optimizing internal systems, managing client relationships, and collaborating with
                        cross-functional teams to ensure flawless payment processes.
