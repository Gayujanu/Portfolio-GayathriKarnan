Personal Portfolio Website | Gayathri Karnan

This is my personal portfolio website, developed as my first step toward becoming a Full-Stack Developer. The website is built with HTML and CSS, featuring two main pages: Home and Contact.

Pages:
Home: The main page that introduces who I am, highlights my skills, and Interest.
Contact: A simple contact page that allows visitors to reach out to me directly, showcasing my growing knowledge in web forms and user interaction.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For the structure and content of the website.
CSS: For styling and layout, ensuring the website looks clean and is easy to navigate.
Responsive Design: The website is responsive, meaning it adjusts well to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
This project represents the beginning of my journey in web development, and I'm constantly learning and enhancing my skills. Iâ€™m excited to continue building on this foundation as I work toward becoming a full-stack developer.

Feel free to explore my website, and stay tuned for future updates as I expand my portfolio with new projects and technologies.
